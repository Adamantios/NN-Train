# NN-Train
Partly automate the training procedure of a neural network for image classification.  
The script can be easily changed/extended by adapting the basic functions before main.
Please note that the "complicated ensembles" work only for a specific number of classes 
and need to be changed for different numbers of classes. 
Refer to the comments of their submodels labels manipulation functions, 
in order to see the classes for which they work.
